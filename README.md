# pushy-demo-expo

A demo of the [Pushy SDK for React Native](https://github.com/pushy/pushy-react-native) integrated into a sample Expo app.

> [Pushy](https://pushy.me/) is the most reliable platform for time-critical, worldwide push notification delivery.

This app registers your device to receive push notifications and assigns it a unique token, which you can copy and paste into the [demo page](https://pushy.me/docs/resources/demo) to send yourself a test push notification on both Android and iOS.

Visit our documentation to [integrate Pushy into your existing React Native / Expo app](https://pushy.me/docs/additional-platforms/react-native).
